# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect childNodes Access After textContent Modification

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to accessing HTML elements using `childNodes` after modifying the `textContent` property.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when attempting to access the `nodeValue` of a `childNodes` element after the `textContent` property has been modified.  In some situations, this approach may not work as expected because the structure of `childNodes` can change when you modify the `textContent`. This can especially happen when the initial text content contains child elements like text nodes, and then we replace this content using `textContent`.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `bug.html` file in your web browser.
3. Observe the text content of the div element.  The initial text should be visible and then the text will get changed to 'This text will replace the existing text.'

The commented-out line in `bug.html` shows where the error can potentially occur.  Uncomment the line to see the error in action.

## Bug Solution

The correct approach is to avoid the use of `childNodes` entirely after changing `textContent`. Instead, rely on `textContent` itself to manipulate the text content of the element and then read from `textContent`.  See `bugSolution.html` for the corrected code.

## Solution

The solution avoids attempting to access the `childNodes` after modifying `textContent`. Use `textContent` for reading the modified content after altering the `textContent` property. This is a more reliable and simpler way to handle text content manipulation in HTML elements.
